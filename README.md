# SimpleCodable

This is "VERY" simple Decoder to try out some concepts.

Possible *simple* use cases include
- Read a SQL Row into a Codable struct or class
- Read an NSObject using KVC into a Codable struct or class

TODO
- Implement Encoder
+ Add Nested KeyedContainters
- Add Nested UnkeyedContainers (e.g. Array)
